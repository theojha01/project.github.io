Five Robots that could change the world.!!
</font><br>
From powered exoskeletons that enable you to lift heavy objects, to robot simians that clean up nuclear accidents, robotic technologies are developing incredibly quickly. Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory chief engineer, Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, talks to the BBC through five robots that could change the world.

Robohub Podcast #248: Semi-active Prostheses, with Peter Adamczyk
</font><br>
In this episode, Audrow Nash interviews Peter Adamczyk, Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, on semi-active foot and ankle prostheses. The difference is that active below-knee prostheses work to move the person’s weight, emulating the calf muscle, while semi-active devices use small amounts of power to improve the performance of the prosthesis. Adamczyk discusses the motivation for semi-active devices and gives three examples: shiftable shapes, controllable keels, and alignable ankles.

Robots to be in 10% of U.S. Homes by 2020
</font><br>
At least 10% of U.S. homes (1 in 10) may contain a service robot by 2020, if a recent report by Juniper Research is to be believed. Many may be surprised that at least 1 in 25 homes in the U.S. already contain at least one robot. However, this study finds that in the next 4 years this number will more than double.
Although we are far from the ubiquitous robots of many Science Fiction movies, Juniper Research found that increasingly people are learning to trust robots. This has been helped greatly by robot designers who have been developing robots that don’t get caught in the so called ‘uncanny valley’.
Juniper Research also found that their will be continued growth in businesses such as restaurants and hotels using robots. However, they say there will be a shift from these robots being used for purely novelty reasons, to actually providing a useful service.
