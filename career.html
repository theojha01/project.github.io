Two common professions in this discipline are robotics technicians and robotics engineers. The differences between the two begin primarily with education level. Robotics technicians typically hold 2-year associate degrees in robot technology or a similar field, while engineers need at least a bachelor's degree; aspiring engineers often move on to graduate studies and professional engineering certification. Technicians generally participate in apprenticeship programs that provide on-the-job training along with classroom instruction.
Both engineers and technicians have several specialties to choose from within the field of robotics. Some of these include machine automation, medical robotics, cybernetics, quantum mechanical systems, air traffic management and a variety of other areas that utilize robots to make work processes easier for humans. Types of businesses that hire professionals for robotics positions comprise electronics, automotive, agricultural and manufacturing companies, among many others. Most robotics professionals work primarily in a collaborative team setting, with technicians assisting and supporting engineers.
